# Go Training

## Description

This repository was created to track my progress in learning the Go programming language.

## Purpose

Learning Go is part of my path to mastering the skills necessary for a Cloud Engineer / DevOps role,
as I have found it to be great in cloud-native microservice environments,
especially those based on container architecture.
